                <p><b>About The Website</b></p>
                <p>Hello, welcome to my web site!<br/>
                    My name is Alex. I enjoy programming in Java. I love learning new things about Java and sharing my
                    experience with everyone. Most of applications and websites are dependent on Java. Right from game
                    consoles to cell phones java is ruling the technical market.
                    My website aims to provide detailed articles and tutorials about design patterns in Java which are
                    written and developed from a developer perspective. Most of the articles include examples which are
                    shown in this website and are available in my repository. <br/>
                    Everyone can download for free from
                    https://github.com/malexj and analyze them. Ask all the questions you need to. Don't be afraid to
                    ask for help.
                </p>
                <p><b>Why do I do all this?</b></p>
                <p> Writing articles for this website provides me a chance to
                    investigate and get my hands dirty with technologies that I never used before or I just heard of. I
                    do lots of reading and experiments before I write an article and this takes time. But so far it is
                    worth the effort.</p>
